Here u are welcomed with two buttons (home,about), so we click on them and see what changes. 

If we look at the part of the url which is "index.php?page=about" which gives a possibility that there maybe a page other than home and about where the password may be stored.

So we look at the source code to find any possible paths to the file and we can clearly the the path is given as a hint. 

So we attach the path in place of about or home (index.php?page=about) and we get the password.
