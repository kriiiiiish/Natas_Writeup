!!!  Access disallowed. You are not logged in !!!

Now we think about how a website knows we are logged in or not.

They use 'cookies' to do that, so if we can modify the cookie we can get the pass. 

Burp again comes in handy, we use it to intercept the request and in repeater we change the value of 'loggedin' to 1 and send the request to get the password.
